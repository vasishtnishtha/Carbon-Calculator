Carbon Calculator
The Carbon Calculator is a web application built with Streamlit that enables users to estimate their carbon footprint based on daily transportation, electricity consumption, meals, and waste generation. By selecting their country and providing inputs such as distance traveled, electricity used, meals consumed, and waste produced, users can calculate their annual carbon emissions across different categories.


Features
Country-specific Emission Factors: Utilizes predefined emission factors for transportation, electricity, diet, and waste based on the selected country.
Interactive Input Controls: Includes sliders and number inputs for intuitive data entry.
Calculation and Display: Computes and displays annual carbon emissions in tonnes CO2 per year for each category and total carbon footprint upon user request.
Educational Information: Provides insights into the environmental impact of user inputs and compares them to global and historical emission data.
Usage
Select Your Country: Choose your country from the dropdown menu.
Input Data:
Adjust sliders or enter values for daily transportation, monthly electricity consumption, weekly waste generation, and daily meals.
