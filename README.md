Carbon Calculator
The Carbon Calculator is a web application built with Streamlit that enables users to estimate their carbon footprint based on daily transportation, electricity consumption, meals, and waste generation. By selecting their country and providing inputs such as distance traveled, electricity used, meals consumed, and waste produced, users can calculate their annual carbon emissions across different categories.
